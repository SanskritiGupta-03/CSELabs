ALGORITHM SelectionSort(A[0..n − 1])
Sorts //Sorts a given array by selection sort
//Input: An array A[0..n − 1] of orderable elements
//Output: Array A[0..n − 1] sorted in nondecreasing order


for i ←0 to n − 2 do
  min←i
  for j ←i + 1 to n − 1 do
    if A[j ]<A[min]
       min←j
    end if
  end for
  swap A[i] and A[min]
end for


Time Complexity:
= θ(n^2 )
This can be observed by repeating the experiment with the worst case inputs for
different array sizes say 10, 15, 20, 35, 100. A plot of number of elements in the array
vs opcount (opcount is shown in the sample code) gives a quadratic curve.
